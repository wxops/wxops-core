# Solution Matrix — AI Intelligence × Multi-Cluster × Observability

>[!NOTE]
> **Status: summary index, kept current by hand.**
> One page over the whole doc family: every problem across the three domains, the chosen tool or solution, **what W'xOps solves today with existing packages** vs. what must be introduced, the detail doc for each, and the publicly documented industry practice to learn from. Read it as a map for brainstorming and prioritising — each row links to the place where the reasoning lives.

**Legend — W'xOps state**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Solved today, shipping in a current package |
| 🔶 | Partially solved — mechanism exists, a piece is missing |
| 📋 | Designed in the docs, not implemented |
| ❌ | Not started — needs the named component |
| ⛔ | Deliberately rejected — do not reopen without new information |

| O14 | Declared vs observed dependency graph | Diff the XR tree (declared) against flow data (observed) — undeclared egress, undocumented dependencies | ❌ **the strongest flow argument here** — needs O13 + the existing XR topology | [observability.md §where this pays off](observability.md#where-this-pays-off-for-the-sre-agent-goal) | Service-map drift detection; the ops and security cases coincide |
| O15 | Runtime security signal (kernel) | Falco (detect-only, CNCF-graduated) → `falcosidekick` push; Tetragon/KubeArmor add enforcement | ❌ not started — **detect-only, advisory**, mirroring Guardian Phase 1; *what* to detect is the threat model's call | [security-threat-model.md](security-threat-model.md) · [observability.md §detect vs enforce](observability.md#detect-versus-enforce-is-the-real-axis) | Falco rule-tuning practice — the cost is tuning, not install |

## What must be introduced — consolidated

The "or more should be introduced" answer, split by where the work lands:

**Changes to existing packages** (all `safe`-tier, all follow the `monitoring` pattern):

| Change | Package | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `status.notReady` reasons | all seven | O5, A1–A3 — the cheapest, highest-leverage item on this page |
| `monitoring.alerts` (PrometheusRule + `runbook_url`) | `XTenantApp` | O6, A3 |
| `scheduling:` block | `XTenantApp`, `XPlatformDatabaseCluster` | M11–M12 |
| Widen `resources` for extended keys (GPU) | `XTenantApp` | M12 |
| `ingress.gslb` block | `XTenantApp` | M8 — blocked on the Traefik↔k8gb spike |

**New XRDs / packages** (both already named in the docs, neither committed):

| Candidate | Serves | Where argued |
|---|---|---|
| `XDarlane` — standalone workspace claim (per-developer, per-agent, TTL) | A10–A11, Guardian's stated prerequisite | [darlane.md](darlane.md#whats-next-xdarlane-xrd) |
| `XPlatformCluster` — CAPI cluster as a platform API, the cluster-scope `tier: dedicated` | M2, M10 | [multi-cluster-scale.md](multi-cluster-scale.md) (currently out-of-scope in [multi-cluster.md](multi-cluster.md#out-of-scope) — graduates when manual provisioning is stable) |

**Platform infrastructure** (not packages — installed once, per hub or per spoke): spoke `ProviderConfig` + credentials · CAPI + `ClusterResourceSet` · Pinniped Supervisor/Concierge · tunnel (Tailscale/Teleport) · Thanos-or-equivalent + Loki · event exporter (O11) · ExternalDNS routing policies / k8gb · **kernel plane** — Hubble (O13), runtime-security DaemonSet (O15).

The kernel plane is the one bucket where cost is wildly uneven, so it does not collapse into a
single line:

| Component | Serves | Cost | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hubble** — enable on existing Cilium | O13, O14 | **~zero, if Cilium** | ⚠️ Confirm the CNI first — Cilium is assumed in a *proposed* spoke bootstrap, never confirmed for the running cluster. Set flow-label granularity (L1b) *before* enabling |
| **Retina** — only for non-Cilium spokes | O13 | Medium, per spoke | Optional. The alternative is accepting a non-uniform signal across the fleet, which is probably the right call |
| **Falco** — detect-only, `falcosidekick` push | O15 | Medium + **ongoing tuning** | A privileged DaemonSet on every node. Budget the tuning or do not start |

**No XRD or composition change is required for any of it** — which is the point of the ownership
split in [observability.md](observability.md#ownership-what-belongs-here-and-what-does-not). The
kernel plane is collected like every other signal: same push direction, same label contract, same
cardinality ladder. If it ever needs a field on `XTenantApp`, that is the signal something has gone
wrong in the design.

**Ecosystem** (around core, not in it): portal correlation fork (A2) · docs site as runbook CDN · ADR/RFC issue templates + `docs/incidents/` convention · SRE-agent skill tree ([knowledge-architecture.md](knowledge-architecture.md#the-darlane-sre-agent-mindmap)) · Guardian sidecars · declared-vs-observed dependency diff (O14 — the XR tree supplies the declared graph, flow data the observed one; the delta is the artefact).

## How to use this page

Brainstorming: pick a row, read its detail doc, then its industry reference — the row is the claim, the doc is the reasoning, the reference is the practiced version at scale. Prioritising: everything ✅ needed no decision; everything 🔶 has a named missing piece; the ❌ rows are ordered inside their detail docs' own sequenced-adoption sections, not here. And the two ⛔ rows exist so this page also records what *not* to reopen.

The single thread across all three domains, stated once: **the platform's declarative core is what makes every hard problem cheaper** — status makes diagnosis walkable (A1), one-XR-per-cluster makes fleets portal-shaped (M7), the declared dependency graph makes drift detectable by subtraction (O14), and PR-through-the-gate makes even AI-suggested fixes as safe as human ones (A9). Every new component above either feeds that core or consumes it; anything that competes with it (Karmada's API composition-emitted RBAC, ungated auto-remediation) is where the ⛔ rows come from.
