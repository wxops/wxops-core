## `spec.parameters`

### Tier resolution

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cluster` | `string` | | `"default"` | Name of the provider-kubernetes `ProviderConfig` to apply composed resources through. Not to be confused with `clusterRef` below, which names a *CNPG* cluster — this is the Kubernetes cluster the resources land on. `"default"` is the local hub, so leaving this unset is behaviour-neutral. See [multi-cluster.md](../core-ideas/multi-cluster.md). |
| `tier` | `string` (`shared`, `dedicated`) | | `"shared"` | **`shared`** — auto-assign to the least-loaded `XPlatformDatabaseCluster` labeled `shared: true` and matching this database's `environment`. The composition discovers shared clusters at render time via `function-extra-resources`, counts existing tenant databases per cluster, and picks the one with the fewest tenants. Prevents `dbName` collisions per cluster. The assignment is **sticky** — once resolved, subsequent reconciles reuse the same cluster. **`dedicated`** — compose a new `XPlatformDatabaseCluster` as a child resource (1 cluster = 1 database, fully isolated). Size the child cluster via `dedicatedCluster`. Ignored if `clusterRef`/`clusterNamespace` are set explicitly. |
| `environment` | `string` (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) | | `"dev"` | Pool isolation: for `tier: shared`, the pool is filtered to clusters matching this environment. For `tier: dedicated`, passed through to the child cluster's `environment` field. |
| `dedicatedCluster` | `object` | | `{}` | Cluster sizing parameters when `tier` is `dedicated`. Ignored for `tier: shared` or when `clusterRef` is set explicitly. |
| `dedicatedCluster.instances` | `integer` (1–9) | | `1` | PostgreSQL instances. `1` = standalone, `3` = HA. |
| `dedicatedCluster.storageSize` | `string` | | `"8Gi"` | PVC storage size per instance. |
| `dedicatedCluster.postgresVersion` | `integer` | | `16` | PostgreSQL major version. |
| `dedicatedCluster.enablePooler` | `boolean` | | `true` | Deploy a PgBouncer RW pooler on the dedicated cluster. |
| `dedicatedCluster.namespace` | `string` | | `"cnpg-system"` | Namespace for the dedicated cluster. |
| `clusterRef` | `string` | | | Name of the platform cluster to provision this database on. Must match the `clusterName` of an existing `XPlatformDatabaseCluster`. When set (along with `clusterNamespace`), bypasses all tier logic. |
| `clusterNamespace` | `string` | | | Kubernetes namespace where the CNPG cluster lives. When set (along with `clusterRef`), bypasses all tier logic. |

### Database

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dbName` | `string` | yes | | PostgreSQL database name to create. Must be unique per cluster. |
| `owner` | `string` | yes | | Team or project identifier (e.g. `"rocket-team"`). Used to scope the Vault path and PostgreSQL role name. |
| `extensions` | `array<string>` | | `[]` | PostgreSQL extensions to enable in the database. Example: `[uuid-ossp, pgcrypto, postgis]`. |
| `databaseReclaimPolicy` | `string` (`delete`, `retain`) | | `"retain"` | CNPG `Database.spec.databaseReclaimPolicy`. `"retain"` (default) protects this tenant's database from XR/claim deletion: the database and its owning role both survive XR deletion and must be cleaned up manually if the tenant is decommissioned. Set to `"delete"` to have CNPG drop the database on XR deletion (which also allows the owning role to be dropped) — a `ClusterUsage` (`tenant-role-db-usage`) orders this so the role's `DROP ROLE` runs only after the database's `DROP DATABASE` has completed, avoiding the `2BP01` parallel-deletion race. Also controls the connection-creds Secret and its ExternalSecret/Password-generator: `"retain"` orphans them on XR deletion (existing password preserved); `"delete"` removes them (recreation generates a new password). A second `ClusterUsage` (`tenant-conn-role-usage`) orders connection-creds Secret deletion after `DROP ROLE` completes — otherwise provider-sql's `Observe()` deadlocks. |
| `vaultSecretStoreName` | `string` | | `"vault-cluster-store"` | Name of the ESO `ClusterSecretStore` used by the `PushSecret` that writes connection creds to Vault at `tenants/{owner}/databases/{dbName}/connection-creds`. The store is scoped to the `tenants/` KV mount, so the KCL code uses `{owner}/databases/{dbName}/connection-creds` as the `remoteKey` (same pattern as `platform-database-clusters` omitting `platform/`). Consuming that Vault entry into an app namespace is a tenant/GitOps concern — see [`tenant-app`](tenant-app.md)'s `secretsFrom.database` toggle. |

> **Password rotation** is intentionally not implemented: `provider-sql`'s `Role` reconciler only sets the role's password at `Create()` time and never re-applies changes on an existing role, so any rotation must also converge Postgres itself — a platform-level concern (e.g. Vault Database Secrets Engine dynamic/rotated roles), tracked separately in the backlog.

> **Changing `databaseReclaimPolicy` on a live XR**: switching from `retain`
> to `delete` and then deleting the XR will clean up the Kubernetes resources
> (Database, Role, Secrets, PushSecret) but **will not remove the Vault
> entry**. The PushSecret's `deletionPolicy` is updated to `Delete`, but
> ESO only honours that for entries it created under a `Delete` policy — the
> original entry was written under `retain` (`deletionPolicy: None`), so ESO
> does not consider it owned for deletion. The stale Vault entry must be
> cleaned up manually:
> ```bash
> vault kv metadata delete tenants/{owner}/databases/{dbName}/connection-creds
> ```
> This only affects the `retain → delete` transition. XRs created with
> `delete` from the start have full lifecycle cleanup (create → delete →
> Vault entry removed).

## Channels

Every release labels its Composition `channel: stable`; `make install-dev` overrides it to
`channel: nightly` via Kustomize. Track a channel with `spec.crossplane`, a sibling of
`spec.parameters`, not a field inside it:

```yaml
spec:
  parameters: {...}
  crossplane:
    compositionRevisionSelector:
      matchLabels:
        channel: stable          # or nightly
    compositionUpdatePolicy: Automatic
```

Full mechanism, the `Manual`-pin alternative, and why: [Channels](../development/releasing.md#channels).

## `status`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clusterRef` | `string` | Resolved CNPG cluster name this database is provisioned on. Sticky once assigned; other `XTenantDatabase` XRs read this via `function-extra-resources` for per-cluster tenant counting. |
| `clusterNamespace` | `string` | Namespace of the resolved cluster. |
| `tier` | `string` | Resolved tier (`shared`, `dedicated`, or `explicit`). |
| `dbName` | `string` | PostgreSQL database name (echoed for cross-XR collision checks). |
| `created` | `boolean` | True once every composed resource has been observed at least once. Indicates provisioning has started, not that it succeeded. |
| `ready` | `boolean` | True when the database is usable: it exists, its owning role exists, and the connection Secret has materialised (plus, on `tier: dedicated`, the child cluster is up). Derived from observed composed-resource state rather than the native `type: Ready` condition, which is unreliable on Crossplane v2.3 with function-kcl v0.12.1. **Poll this field, not conditions.** The Vault credential push (`PushSecret`) is deliberately excluded — if it lags, applications can still connect. |

## Required discovery labels

`XTenantDatabase` uses `function-extra-resources` to discover both shared
clusters and peer databases. Each resource type requires a specific label in
its manifest for the selectors to find it:

| Resource | Required label | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `XPlatformDatabaseCluster` | `wxops.cloud/managed-by: platform-database-clusters` | Discovered as candidate for `tier: shared` pool |
| `XTenantDatabase` | `wxops.cloud/tenant-database: "true"` | Discovered for per-cluster tenant counting and `dbName` collision detection |

Both labels **must be in the XR manifest** — they cannot be set by the
composition. Crossplane's composite reconciler writes `status` from dxr
updates but ignores `metadata.labels`, so discovery labels must be applied
by the user or GitOps.

Without the `XTenantDatabase` label, the composition still works for a
single database but **cannot detect collisions or balance load** across
clusters for subsequent databases.

## Examples

- [`examples/tenant-database/xr.yaml`](../../examples/tenant-database/xr.yaml) — shared tier (default)
- [`examples/tenant-database/xr-dedicated.yaml`](../../examples/tenant-database/xr-dedicated.yaml) — dedicated tier
