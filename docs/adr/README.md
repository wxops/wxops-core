# Architecture Decision Records

One committed file per decision of lasting consequence — a tool adoption, an architectural boundary,
a convention, a deliberate rejection. An ADR records *why*, so the reasoning behind a decision stays
discoverable independent of anyone's memory of the conversation that produced it.

**Template:** [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) — copy it, don't start from a blank page.

## Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** — open a
   [GitHub issue](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adr.md) if the decision needs discussion first. Small,
   clearly-reasoned decisions can skip straight to step 2.
2. **Accepted** — committed here as `NNN-title.md`, numbered sequentially, using the template. The
   issue (if one existed) becomes the discussion trail; this file is the permanent record.
3. **Superseded** — a later decision that reverses or replaces an earlier one is a *new* ADR that
   says so in its own Context section and links back. An accepted ADR is never edited after the fact
   — that would erase the record this convention exists to keep.

Related: an [RFC issue](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rfc.md) argues a design *before* it happens, when
the open question is an option space rather than a single decision. An accepted RFC often produces an
ADR as its residue.
