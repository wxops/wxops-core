# Status contract — what the portal can poll today

One page, cross-package: every field a portal (or any external consumer) can
read from an XR's `status` right now, as of the Phase 0 API-freeze batch (see
[`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md#phase-0--api-freeze)). Each package's own doc has
the full field-by-field detail with rationale; this page exists so a portal
engineer doesn't have to open all seven to answer "what can I poll?"

## The one rule that applies everywhere

**Poll `status.ready` / `status.created`, never the native `type: Ready`
condition.** Crossplane v2.3 with function-kcl v0.12.1 leaves that condition
unreliable (see [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — Testing) — every KCL-based
package derives its own `ready`/`created` from observed composed-resource state
instead; each package's status section below has the exact derivation. All
seven packages now expose the same two field names, so the polling logic is
identical across packages — only the extra fields differ.

## API version

**All seven XRDs serve `v1alpha1` only.** This is a decision, not an
oversight — recorded in [`VERSIONS.yaml`](../VERSIONS.yaml). Every Phase 0
change is additive, so nothing forced a bump; promotion to `v1beta1` is
deferred to the Phase 4 OSS release, the natural point to make a stability
commitment. **The portal should expect to pin `v1alpha1` for its first
integration** — that is accepted, not a temporary gap to work around.

## Per-package status contract

| Package | Kind | `created` | `ready` | Extra fields | Contract note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`gitea-user`](gitea-user.md#status) | `XGiteaUser` | bool, **absent** until first apply | bool, **absent** until first apply | `userId`, `username` | Absent ≠ `false` — this package's only deviation from the rest. Treat absent as not-ready. |
| [`gitea-org`](gitea-org.md#status) | `XGiteaOrg` | bool, absent-until-apply | bool, absent-until-apply | `orgId`, `orgName` | Same absent-not-false caveat. |
| [`gitea-team`](gitea-team.md#status) | `XGiteaTeam` | bool, absent-until-apply | bool, absent-until-apply | `teamId`, `teamName` | Same absent-not-false caveat. |
| [`gitea-repository`](gitea-repository.md#status) | `XGiteaRepository` | bool, absent-until-apply | bool, absent-until-apply | `repoId`, `cloneUrl`, `sshUrl`, `htmlUrl` | Same absent-not-false caveat. |
| [`platform-database-clusters`](platform-database-clusters.md#status) | `XPlatformDatabaseCluster` | bool, explicit `false` | bool, explicit `false` | `clusterName`, `namespace`, `shared`, `environment` | `ready` excludes Vault seeding and scheduled backups on purpose — neither stops a running cluster serving. |
| [`tenant-database`](tenant-database.md#status) | `XTenantDatabase` | bool, explicit `false` | bool, explicit `false` | `clusterRef`, `clusterNamespace`, `tier`, `dbName` | `ready` excludes the Vault credential push — a lagging push doesn't stop the app connecting. |
| [`tenant-app`](tenant-app.md#status) | `XTenantApp` | bool, explicit `false` | bool, explicit `false`, **workload-scoped** | `dependenciesReady`, `darlane.*`, `url`, `namespace`, `image` | See the split below — `ready` alone is not the full health picture for this package. |

The **absent-vs-`false`** split is real and package-group-wide: the four
`gitea-*` packages use `function-patch-and-transform`, patching values out of
Terraform outputs via `ToCompositeFieldPath` with an `Optional` policy — the
patch simply doesn't run before the first successful apply, so the field is
missing from the object rather than present-and-`false`. The three
function-kcl packages compute an explicit boolean every reconcile, so they're
always present. **A portal client should treat a missing field the same as
`false`, not as an error.**

## `tenant-app` — the one package that needs two fields, not one

`ready` on `XTenantApp` is deliberately **scoped to the core workload**
(Deployment, Service, Ingress) and excludes the cert-manager `Certificate`.
Polling `ready` alone means the portal can render "Ready ✅" while TLS is
still issuing.

```yaml
status:
  created: true
  ready: true              # core workload only
  dependenciesReady: false  # e.g. Certificate not yet issued
  url: "https://payment-api.rocket-team.example.com"
  namespace: rocket-team-production
  image: ghcr.io/rocket-team/payment-api:1.4.0
```

**Render both fields, not one.** The honest UI state is three-valued in
practice: not ready / ready but dependencies pending / fully ready — collapsing
to a single boolean loses the middle state, which is a real and common one (a
freshly-applied XR with `ingress.tls.clusterIssuer` set spends real time in it).

`XTenantApp` does **not** compose an `XTenantDatabase`. `secretsFrom.database`
only wires an existing Secret in by name and is never waited on, so database
readiness is not — and cannot be — reflected in either field. If the portal
needs combined app+database health, it polls `XTenantDatabase.status.ready`
separately and combines client-side.

### Darlane sub-status

Present only when `darlane.enabled: true` — **absent entirely**, not an empty
object, when the twin isn't in use:

```yaml
status:
  darlane:
    ready: true
    replicas: 1                              # OBSERVED, not desired — read from
                                               # the Deployment manifest provider-
                                               # kubernetes writes back
    trafficMode: weighted                     # none | weighted | header | both
    ttl: "4h"                                 # a DURATION, not an expiry timestamp —
                                               # combine with the Deployment's
                                               # creationTimestamp to compute one
    serviceAccountName: payment-api-darlane   # the RBAC binding target, not a grant —
                                               # this repo's compositions never emit
                                               # RBAC; see ROADMAP.md "Decided and
                                               # rejected"
```

If the portal offers an "open shell into Darlane" action, `serviceAccountName`
is what a GitOps-authored `RoleBinding` targets — the composition itself
grants nothing.

## Monitoring — `tenant-app` only, input not status

`spec.parameters.monitoring` is a **write path**, not something the portal
polls — flagged here because it's the field most likely to be confused with a
status field, and because the portal's own toggle for it was previously wired
to a mechanism that never worked.

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  kind: auto           # auto | ServiceMonitor | PodMonitor — auto resolves on service.enabled
  port: 9090            # no schema default — falls back to containerPort
  path: /metrics
  interval: 30s
  scrapeTimeout: 10s
  sampleLimit: 5000
  honorLabels: false
  metricRelabelings: []
```

**If the portal's UI already has a "Monitoring" toggle, it was wired to
`prometheus.io/*` pod annotations — those do nothing on this platform** (see
[observability.md](observability.md) for why). Repoint that toggle at
`spec.parameters.monitoring.enabled` instead; nothing else about the toggle's
UX needs to change.

There is no status-side confirmation that a `ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor` was
actually created and is scraping successfully — that lives in Prometheus's own
`/targets` page, outside this API. The portal can infer "the field was
accepted" from the XR's `Synced` condition, but not "metrics are flowing."

## `cluster` — every package, input not status

`spec.parameters.cluster` (all seven packages via `platform-database-clusters`,
`tenant-database`, `tenant-app` — the four `gitea-*` packages don't have it,
since a Gitea `Workspace` targets a Gitea server over HTTP, not a Kubernetes
cluster). Defaults to `"default"`, the local hub. **Behaviour-neutral until a
spoke `ProviderConfig` exists** — see [multi-cluster.md](multi-cluster.md). Not
yet consumed anywhere; safe for the portal to ignore until multi-cluster work
lands, at which point it becomes the field that selects a target cluster per XR.
