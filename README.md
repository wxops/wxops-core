# W'xOps Core

***"Ask Kubernetes for a Gitea user, a PostgreSQL database, or a full application deployment — get a real one back."***

> [!NOTE]
> W'xOps Core is a library of [Crossplane v2](https://docs.crossplane.io/v2.3/) Configuration packages: each one defines a schema (an `XRD`) and the logic that
> turns it into real infrastructure (a `Composition`), so `kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml` provisions a Gitea account, a CloudNativePG database, or a
> Deployment/Service/IngressRoute stack — no custom controller, no platform UI required to use it.

## The problem this solves

Standing up a new tenant app or database today usually means: click through Gitea's UI to create a repo, hand-write Terraform for the database, copy-paste a
Deployment Service/Ingress from the last app that looked similar, and wire the secrets together by hand. Every step is a manual, undocumented, tribal-knowledge
operation.

W'xOps Core turns each of those into a Kubernetes object with a schema: `XGiteaUser`, `XTenantDatabase`, `XTenantApp`, and four more. Crossplane reconciles them
the same way it reconciles anything else — continuously, declaratively, with `status` fields you can poll instead of watching a Terraform apply scroll by. What
actually executes underneath (Terraform against a Gitea provider, or Kubernetes objects composed via KCL) is an implementation detail the schema hides.

This repo is **only the Configuration packages** — the schemas and the composition logic. It has no UI, no CLI, and no build pipeline; **see [Out of
scope](ROADMAP.md#out-of-scope--what-wxops-core-is-not) for the deliberate boundary.**

Served XRD API versions, and the release each package last changed in, are tracked in [`VERSIONS.yaml`](VERSIONS.yaml). Releases are named by date —
`release-YYYY-MM-DD` — and compatibility is the API version, not the release name; see [`docs/development/releasing.md`](docs/development/releasing.md).

## Documentation

Everything is linked from one hub, [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md), which also holds the **development matrix**: every package, core idea and delivery
mechanism, where it stands, and what is next.

| Section | For | Start with |
|---|---|---|
| [API reference](docs/api-reference/README.md) | What each Kind accepts, what Core composes and keeps reconciled, what it reports | The reconcile loop from your side, then one page per Kind |
| [Core ideas](docs/README.md#core-ideas) | Darlane, Guardian, multi-cluster, observability, self-service operations, security | [Solution matrix](docs/core-ideas/solution-matrix.md) |
| [User guide](docs/README.md#user-guide) | Installing Core and building on it | [Setup](docs/user-guide/setup.md) · [App onboarding](docs/user-guide/app-onboarding.md) |
| [Development](docs/development/README.md) | Changing, testing, releasing and rolling out Core | [Development guide](docs/development/README.md) · [Releasing](docs/development/releasing.md) |

## Why Crossplane + Terraform

![W'xOps Core on Crossplane — the runtime (RBAC manager), the definitions layer (Providers, Functions and Configurations composing into XRDs and Compositions), and a composite resource fanning out to real Kubernetes, database and cloud resources](images/w'xops-core-crossplane.png)

The shape above is what every package in this repo is an instance of — a `Configuration` package contributing an `XRD` + `Composition`, which a
`CompositeResourceDefinition` turns into a composite resource (XR) that Crossplane creates and reconciles against real infrastructure. It's a structural map,
not a substitute for [Crossplane's own docs](https://docs.crossplane.io/v2.3/) — read those for what each piece actually does.

The previous direction used `kubebuilder` to build a controller from scratch. That was **rejected** — too much complexity for the problem.

The current approach combines two tools with clear roles:

- **Crossplane** owns the platform API layer: `XRD`s define the schema, `Composition`s wire them to infrastructure, and the control loop reconciles desired state.
- **Terraform** (via `provider-terraform`) owns the infrastructure execution: each `Workspace` resource runs a plan/apply cycle in-cluster against a Gitea Terraform provider.

Composition functions may be written in Python, Go, CEL, KCL, or Go templating. The `kcl/` directory holds KCL-based composition logic for
`platform-database-clusters`, `tenant-database`, and `tenant-app` — see [KCL composition functions](#kcl-composition-functions) below.

## Quick start

```bash
make providers                                            # once per cluster
kubectl create secret generic gitea-credentials \
  --from-literal=credentials='gitea_token = "your-admin-token"' -n crossplane-system
make install                                              # packages from the OCI registry
kubectl apply -f examples/gitea-user/xr.yaml
kubectl get xgiteausers
```

Prerequisites, the platform dependencies each package needs, credential formats and uninstalling are in the [setup guide](docs/user-guide/setup.md). What each
resource does once it exists is in the [API reference](docs/api-reference/README.md).

---

## Development

```bash
pre-commit install --install-hooks
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push --hook-type commit-msg
make test-deps && make test        # the offline merge gate — no cluster needed
```

Every hook, every make target and the rules that bite are in the [development guide](docs/development/README.md); the change loop and the new-package checklist
are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## KCL composition functions

`platform-database-clusters`, `tenant-database`, and `tenant-app` use [`function-kcl`](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/function-kcl) instead of
`function-go-templating`, since their Compositions need real branching/looping across multiple optional resources (conditional resource sets, dict merges, list
comprehensions over arrays like `managedRoles[]`, and — for `tenant-app` — composing a nested `XTenantDatabase` XR). The other packages (`gitea-*`,
`random-password`) are simple enough that inline HCL / Go templating is sufficient.

`kcl/{pkg}/main.k` is the source of truth and is embedded into `package/{pkg}/composition.yaml` via `make kcl-sync` / `make kcl-check`.

See [`kcl/README.md`](kcl/README.md) for why KCL vs Go templating, the sync workflow, how to wire a new KCL module into an XRD, and the deferred OCI-modules
migration plan.

---

## Versioning and releases

Two axes, never mixed: the **XRD API version** (`platform.wxops.cloud/v1alpha1`) is the contract that dev XRs, prod XRs and the portal bind to, and it only ever
grows once released; the **release** (`release-YYYY-MM-DD`) is a dated snapshot of the packages that changed.

```bash
make release           # gate → pin changed packages → CHANGELOG.md → commit + tag release-YYYY-MM-DD
git push origin main && git push origin release-YYYY-MM-DD
```

The API rule, release notes, what CI publishes and the changelog are in [Releasing](docs/development/releasing.md).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, the change loop, and the
checklist for adding a new package.

Every change is gated by an offline test suite — no cluster required:

```bash
make test-deps    # once
make test         # XRD conformance + API compat + golden render tests + invariants
```

`crossplane composition render` runs the real function images in Docker, so the unit under test is the composition itself. See
[tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for what that covers and, importantly, what it does not.
